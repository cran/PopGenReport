\title{Counts and visualises allele frequencies across loci and subpopulations}
\usage{
allele.dist(population, mk.figures = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{population}{this is the \code{\link{genind}} object the analysis will
be based on}

\item{mk.figures}{if set to FALSE no figures are plotted. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
Produces heatmaps of the relative allele frequencies for each
subpopulation at each locus and returns a list containing the counts (count)
for each combination of allele and subpopulation and the relative
frequencies of alleles by subpopulation (frequency) for each locus. The
color bars on the heatmaps shows the relative frequency of an allele within
a subpopulation for a locus while the histogram gives an overall count for
the number of combinations of allele and subpopulation with a relative
frequency.
}
\description{
Counts the number of observations for each combination of allele variant and
subpopulation for each locus. Calculates relative allele proportions for
each subpopulations and then produces a heatmap using that data.
