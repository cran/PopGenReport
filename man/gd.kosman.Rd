\title{Individual genetic distance calculation based on Kosman & Leonhard 2005}
\description{
 Calculates pairwise genetic distances between all individuals using the individual genetic distance measure of Kosman and Leonard (2005). This function is similiar to the dist.codom in the package mmod. The two functions differ in their treatment of individuals with missing data. dist.codom omits individuals from the calculation of pairwise individual genetic distances while this function includes individuals with missing data. This is done by simply calculating the mean individual pairwise genetic distance over all loci for which there are values. Note that depending on your computers capabilities, you may run into memory errors when this function is used on datasets with large numbers of individuals (>1000).

\usage{
gd.kosman(population)
}
\arguments{
  \item{population}{this is the \code{\link{genind}} object the analysis will be based on.}
 }

\value{
Returns a list with two distance matrices. The first (geneticdist) contains pairwise individual genetic distances for each individual within a population, the second (loci_used) provides the number of loci that were used to calculate pairwise individual genetic distances between a pair of individuals.
