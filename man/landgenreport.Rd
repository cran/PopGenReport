\title{
Create a landscape genetic report
}
\description{
This function is the landscape genetic version of the \code{\link{popgenreport}} function. It needs to be provided with a genind object with spatial coordinates, a friction map (raster) and a specification which type of genetic distance should be used.  
Once all three type of input are provided with the necessary input, a landscape genetic analysis using least cost path analysis is computed (see Cushman et al. 2010, Landguth et al. 2010). Depending on the genetic distance meassurement this is done on a subpopulation basis (D, Gst.Hedrick, Gst.Nei=Fst) or on an individual basis (Kosman, Smouse).
}
\usage{
landgenreport(cats, fric.raster, gen.distance = "Gst.Nei", NN=NULL,
pathtype="leastcost", plotpath=TRUE, theta=1, mk.resistance = TRUE , 
mapdotcolor = "blue", mapdotsize=1, mapdotalpha = 0.4, mapdottype = 19, 
mapzoom = NULL,mk.custom = FALSE, fname = "LandGenReport", foldername = "results",
path.pgr = NULL, mk.Rcode = FALSE, mk.complete = FALSE, mk.pdf = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{cats}{ a \code{genind} object with spatial coordinates in the other slot
}
  \item{fric.raster}{ friction (resistance) raster, that specifies the landscape where the analysis should be computed on. If fric.raser is a stack a cost distances are calculated for each layer in the stack.
}
  \item{gen.distance}{type of genetic distance that should be used. Depending on the genetic distance meassurement this is done on a subpopulation basis (D, Gst.Hedrick, Gst.Nei=Fst) or on an individual basis (Kosman, Smouse, propShared). propShared is the proportion of shared alleles between individuals.}
  \item{NN}{Number of neighbours used when calculating the cost distance (possible values 4,8 or 16). As the default is NULL a value has to be provided if pathtype is 'leastcost'. NN=8 is most commonly used as it avoids a directional bias, but be aware that linear structures may cause artefacts in the least-cost paths in the NN=8 case, therefore we strongly recommend to inspect the actual least-cost paths in the provided output.} 
  \item{pathtype}{Type of cost distance to be calculated (based on function in the \code{\link{gdistance}} package. Available distances are 'leastcost', 'commute' or 'rSPDistance'. See functions in the gdistance package for futher explanations.} 
  \item{plotpath}{switch if least cost paths should be plotted (works only if pathtype='leastcost'. Be aware this slows down the computation, but it is recommended to check least cost paths visually.}
  \item{theta}{value needed for rSPDistance function. see \code{\link{rSPDistance}} in package \code{gdistance}.}
  \item{mk.resistance}{ switch to do the landscape genetic analysis based on resistance matrices, should be set to TRUE

\details{
Check the help pages of \code{\link{popgenreport}} how to include coordinates to a genind object. The coordinates need to be projected. Latlongs are not valid, because Euclidean distances are calcuated based on these coordinates. For an example how to convert latlongs into a projected format have a look at the vignette that comes with this package. The friction needs to be a raster and needs to be in the same projection as the genind object. Also the type of genetic distance to be used needs to be specified.
}
\value{
Four distance matrices are returned. Pairwise Euclidean distances between subpopulations/individuals, cost distances, path lengths and genetic distances. Also following the approach of Wassermann et al. 2010 a series of partial mantel tests are performed. A multiple regression analysis based on Wang 2013 and Legendre 1994 is returned.The actual least-cost paths can be found under paths
