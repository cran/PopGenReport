#' Individual genetic distance calculation based on Kosman & Leonhard 2005
#' 
#' Calculates pairwise genetic distances between all individuals using the
#' individual genetic distance measure of Kosman and Leonard (2005). This
#' function is similiar to the dist.codom in the package mmod. The two
#' functions differ in their treatment of individuals with missing data.
#' dist.codom omits individuals from the calculation of pairwise individual
#' genetic distances while this function includes individuals with missing
#' data. This is done by simply calculating the mean individual pairwise
#' genetic distance over all loci for which there are values. Note that
#' depending on your computers capabilities, you may run into memory errors
#' when this function is used on datasets with large numbers of individuals
#' (>1000). Additionally, the time for this function to run can be lengthy.
#' Using a PC with a 3.5 GHz processor to calculate pairwise genetic distances
#' between individuals with 36 diploid loci it took 0.3 seconds for 100
#' individuals, 5 seconds for 500 individuals, 21 seconds for 1000 individuals,
#' 84 seconds for 2000 individuals, and 194 seconds for 3000 individuals.

#' @param population this is the \code{\link{genind}} object the analysis will
#' be based on.
#' @return Returns a list with two distance matrices. The first (geneticdist)
#' contains pairwise individual genetic distances for each individual within a
#' population, the second (loci_used) provides the number of loci that were
#' used to calculate pairwise individual genetic distances between a pair of
#' individuals.
