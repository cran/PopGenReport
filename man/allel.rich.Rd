\title{Calculates the allelic richness for a genind object}
\usage{
allel.rich(population, min.alleles = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{population}{a \code{\link{genind}} object (from package adegenet)}

\item{min.alleles}{the minimum number of alleles that will be sampled for
calculating allelic richness. If min.alleles is set to NULL the min.alleles
sampled will be determined automatically (see description)}
}
\value{
Returns a list with the following entries:

all.richness is the allelic richness for each combination of population and
locus sum.richness is the sum of the allelic richnesses for each population
mean.richness is the mean allelic richness across all loci alleles.sampled
is the smallest number of individuals sampled across all combinations of
population and locus multiplied by the ploidy of the species.  pop.sizes is
a matrix with the total number of alleles counted for each combination of
population and locus.
}
\description{
The function calculates the allelic richness for each combination of
population and locus for a genind object. To account for differences in
sample sizes and genotyping success, rarefication is used in the
calculation. The sample size for each combination of population and locus
was set equal to the smallest number of alleles seen in a sample across all
combinations of population and locus. Allelic richness was calculated using
the methods of Mousadik and Petit (1996) which are in turn based upon the
work of Hurlbert (1971).
}
\details{
This function is similar to the allelic.richness function in hiefstat. The
main differences between the two packages are that allel.rich works on a
genind object while allelic richness works on a data frame and allel.rich is
capable of determining allelic richness for species with most ploidies while
allelic.richness only works for haploid and diploid species.
